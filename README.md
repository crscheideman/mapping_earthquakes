# Mapping Earthquakes
* The purpose of this repository was to create a multi-layered map to display tectonic plate boarders and earthquakes from the past seven days. The earthquakes were displayed based on their strength by the size and color of the the circle representing said earthquake on the map. 
* This was done using Mapbox and Leaflet along with HTML, CSS and JavaScript code.
